    "text": "I’m a Senior Statistician at the RAND Meselson Center working on biosecurity and emerging technology. I’m also the Senior Scientist at Whitespace, a geospatial intelligence company.\nI’m on leave from my other job as a full-time professor at Yale University in the Departments of Biostatistics, Statistics & Data Science, Operations, and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. I have taught courses on stochastic processes, computational statistics, modeling, and causal inference. I have worked on lots of things, including the COVID-19 pandemic response, the opioid overdose crisis, HIV outbreaks, and methods for studying hidden and hard-to-reach populations. In 2016 I received the NIH Director’s New Innovator Award (DP2).\nMy methodological/quantitative interests are broad. I’m interested in AI/ML, applied math, stochastic processes, modeling, causal inference, networks/graphs, computation, optimization, and algorithms.\nI’ve worked in a variety of applied fields, including public health, security, human rights, biomedical science, epidemiology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, bioengineering, radiology, and sociology."
