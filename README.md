# Forrest Crawford's personal website

This repository holds the resources I use to build my (static) [website](http://www.crawfordlab.io). It's a pretty standard Quarto site, except for a few extras:
- I generate the publication list from BibTeX
- I made a few small changes to the formatting

The Makefile assumes the existence of `../cv` and `../bib`, where I keep my resume and bibliography, respectively.  

Requirements: 
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) 
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org) 
- [Pybtex](https://pybtex.org)
