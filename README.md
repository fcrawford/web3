# Forrest Crawford's personalwebsite

This repository holds the resources I use to build my (static) [website](http://www.crawfordlab.io). It's a pretty standard Quarto site, except for a few extras:
- I generate the publication list from BibTeX
- I made a few small changes to the formatting

Requirements: 
- Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). 
- Install Python
- Install the Python package [Pybtex](https://pybtex.org)
