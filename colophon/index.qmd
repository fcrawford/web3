This site is statically generated by [Quarto](http://www.quarto.org), an open-source publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). I use the "journal" theme with minor style and formatting changes. 

I use [bib2bib](https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/bibtex2html/doc/manual.html) to generate the publication lists from BibTeX and [pybtex-convert](https://www.pybtex.org) to generate a [yaml](https://www.yaml.org) database of publications.  

See the [site repository](https://github.com/fcrawford/web2) for more information. 

If you find a problem with this site, please [contact me](/contact)!
