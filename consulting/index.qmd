I occasionally consult for private sector and government clients to help solve challenging inferential problems in biomedical science, epidemiology, human rights, and national security. Examples:

- Outbreak forecasting / analytics
- Detecting election interference
- Designing vaccine trials
- Estimating rates of modern slavery / human trafficking
- Optimizing diagnostic tests
- Causal evaluation of intervention programs
