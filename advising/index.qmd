title: Career Advising
---

I offer free career advising to students and professionals whose interests, experiences, or ambitions line up with mine. You don't have to know me or be affiliated with any particular institution to ask for a meeting.  

If you're interested in speaking with me, please [get in touch](/contact). In your message, please briefly describe:

- your training and work experience, academic or otherwise
- what you're interested in doing in the future 
- what decision or career strategy issue I can help you with. 

Please also include a link to your resume/CV. 

If I think I can help, I'll respond to schedule a time to talk. 


### Caveats 

- I can't advise in areas outside my expertise
- My time is very limited and I cannot respond to all requests
- I can't get you a job or give you an advantage at any particular employer or school
- I'm advising in my personal capacity and not as a representative of any organization
