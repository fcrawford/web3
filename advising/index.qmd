title: Career Advising
---

I offer free career advising to students, early-career researchers, and mid-career professionals whose interests, experiences, or ambitions line up with mine. 

If you're interested in speaking with me, please [get in touch](/contact). In your message, please briefly describe:

- your training and work experience, academic or otherwise
- what you're interested in doing in the future 
- what decision or career strategy issue I can help you with. 

Please also include a link to your resume/CV. 

If I think I can help, I'll respond to schedule a time to talk. 


### Caveats 

- I can't advise in areas outside my expertise
- My time is limited and I cannot respond to every request
- I can't get you a job or give you an advantage at any particular employer or school
- I'm advising in my personal capacity and not as a representative of any organization
